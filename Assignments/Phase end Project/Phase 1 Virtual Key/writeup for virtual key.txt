                                                      WRITE UP FOR VIRTUAL KEY




Project objective: 
------------------

As a Full Stack Developer, complete the features of the application by planning the development in terms of sprints and then push 
the source code to the GitHub repository. As this is a prototyped application, the user interaction will be via a command line. 


-> Virtual Key Repository is a console based application that helps user in managing files in repository. 

-> User can add, delete, and search a file from the repository. 

-> Also, user can access all the files present in repository in ascending order. 

-> This application is based on file handling concepts.


STEP 1: Enter your choice which you want to select
--------------------------------------------------
        
       ->     1. Retrive current filename in Ascending order

       ->     2. Business Level operation Menu.

       ->     3. Exit from the Application


1.RETRIVE CURRENT FILE NAME IN ASCENDING ORDER :
-----------------------------------------------
            
-> I have created a new method called Ascending() 

-> In this method ,the isFile() method that checks whether a File object represents an actual file in the filesystem.

-> isDirectory() method checks whether the file is a directory or not  

-> Array.sort() method is used to sort an array iin the Ascending order

-> If the directory is found or matched , then it will sort the file name in ascending order using array.sort() method

-> If the directory is not found, it will print "File not found"              

STEP 2:

2. BUSINESS LEVEL OPERATION :
-----------------------------

        ->    1: Add a file and its content to the directory 
        
        ->    2: Delete a file from directory 

        ->    3: Searching a file and showing the content 

        ->    4: Exit from the below operation and then come back to the main function.


1. CREATE A FILE 
*****************

-> The createNewFile() function is a part of File class in Java . 

-> This function creates new empty file.

-> If the file name is already exist, then it will print "FILE ALREADY EXISTS"

2. DELETE A FILE FROM THE DIRECTORY:
************************************

-> The Scanner class can take file name from the user.

-> Delete() method is used to delete the file .

-> And it will print "File name deleted successfully"

-> If the file name is not found , it will print "File not found..Please try again"

3. SEARCHING A FILE:
********************

-> The Scanner class can take file name from the user.

-> File.exists() method tests the existence of the file or directory defined by this abstract pathname.

-> If the searched file is found it will print the file name 

-> And also the file location.

-> If the file name is not found , it will print "Sorry !! File not found"

STEP 3: 

3. EXIT FROM THE APPLICATION:
-------------------------------
           
-> Once the user is perfrom all the operation, the user can close the Virtual locker uisng Exit options.
                  
STEP 4:

->In the main method , printing developer name.

-> Using Switch Case , it will print the main menu operations

-> If the user enter the invalid number the it will print "Please enter valid number".
