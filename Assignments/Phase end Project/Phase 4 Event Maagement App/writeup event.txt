								WRITEUP FOR EVENT MANAGEMENT APP
								********************************

Project Agenda: Build an Angular app where the admin can view and manage employees.

Scenario:
********
You are working as a web developer and your company has decided to launch a new app called Event Management. The administration team of the organization can view and add their resources such as employees and keep their data saved for future references. 
The backend development has been outsourced as APIs and the frontend will be developed in-house by using Angular as a client-side framework. During the sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop an app that will let the admin find employees using APIs outsourced by backend engineers. 
The tasks that need to be performed by you are: 
•	Build the application using Angular
•	Create a temporary database server for CRUD operation using a JSON local server
•	Validate all employee management forms using Form Validation
•	Render the application as a Single Page Application

Tools Required:
•	Angular
•	Bootstrap

The Following Requirements Should Be Met:
•	Admin login page where admin can change the password after logging in if he wants to. 
•	Admin can view a master list of employee details.  
•	Admin can create, remove, update, or delete employee details.


Refer the following steps for JSON server creation:
1) Execute the command given below:
npm install -g json-server

2) Create a file with the name db.json and add the code given below:
{
    "employees": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "Sebastian",
        "last_name": "Eschweiler",
        "email": "sebastian@codingthesmartway.com"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "first_name": "Steve",
        "last_name": "Palmer",
        "email": "steve@codingthesmartway.com"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "first_name": "Ann",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "email": "ann@codingthesmartway.com"
      }
    ]
  }
 
3) Add the code given below in the script section of your package.json file in the root folder of your Angular application

    "json:server": "json-server --watch db.json"

Note: Before executing your Angular Application, run the command given below to start your json server:
npm run json-server


STEPS:
******


-> The project is designed to help admin, to handle employees details 

-> Project is coded using angular with html and css. 

-> Admin needs to login using static email and password. 

-> That will consider admin as authenticated user. 

-> Then admin will get dashboard where admin can add new employees with their details and can view the list of employees. 

-> Employees details are first name, last name, email id, phone number and salary 

-> Different components are created for different purposes, like employee dashboard, signin page 

-> Every component is then connected in app component page. 

-> Data are stored in db.json file.

-> Port for angular localhost is 4200, if it is occupied, then we can change the port. 

-> AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes
