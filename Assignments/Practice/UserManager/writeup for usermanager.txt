					---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project objective:
-----------------
Create a Spring MVC web application that will retrieve users based on their user ID. 
The retrieved user data will then be edited in a form and updated in the database. 
The entire database processing has to be done using Hibernate. Front pages will be made in JSP.

-> Create a JSP page to take in a user ID

-> Create a controller that will validate the user ID. 

-> If it is invalid, it will display a JSP page with an error message.

->  If it is valid, it will retrieve user details from the database and show an edit form in JSP

-> Once the edit form is submitted, the controller will update the details in the database

-> A confirmation JSP page will be shown

-> Follow the standard methodology of creating controllers, services, dao, and entity classes

-> Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task
