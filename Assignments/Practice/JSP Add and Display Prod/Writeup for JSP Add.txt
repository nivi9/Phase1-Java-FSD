								Writeup for Product Details Portal
							       -------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:
************

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to enter product details. 
Capture the details in a servlet and then display the data that was entered.

Background of the problem statement:
************************************

As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, you have to prototype a form for 
adding products into the system entered by the users. There is no database involved here, 
so the product is just captured and displayed without storing it anywhere.

Functionalities supported by JSP(Java server Page):
***************************************************

-> JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology.

-> It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality 
   than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc.

-> A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. 

-> The JSP pages are easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and development.

-> It provides some additional features such as Expression Language, Custom Tags, etc.



Product.java:
*************

-> The class product is created to store the product ID, product name , color and Price of the Product.

-> A parameterized constructor along with getters and setters are created for this to show the
   model.

-> The user is asked to enter the product ID, product name, color and Price of the product. The page also
   contains a submit button which takes the user to the display page where the product details are displayed.
