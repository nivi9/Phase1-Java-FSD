                                                            WRITE UP FOR FIXING THE BUGS 


Background of the problem statement:

You have been assigned a few tasks during the sprint planning. Solving the bugs raised
by the testing team is one among them. You are given the boilerplate code and are asked
to complete it by fixing the bugs.


STEP 1: Start

STEP 2: SORTING PROCEDURE

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 

-> The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

-> Run two loops â€“ an inner loop and an outer loop.

-> Repeat steps till the outer loop are exhausted.

-> The current element in the inner loop is smaller than its next element, swap the values of the two elements.


STEP 3: SEARCHING PROCEDURE IN SEARCH EXPENSES

Linear search is also known as a sequential searching algorithm to find the element within the collection of data.
The algorithm begins from the first element of the list, starts checking every element until the expected element is found. 

-> Traversing the array

-> Match the key element with array element

-> If key element is found in the arraylist, return the index position of the array element,

-> It will print the element you searched for is found

-> If key element is not found, return -1,

-> It will print the element is not found.
