                                                                     Writeup for Adding New Product


Project objective:
******************

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new products.
A MySQL database will be created to store product data.
The form data will be validated, and a row will be added to the database. 
All database processing will be done using Hibernate.

Background of the problem statement:
************************************
  As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to create a 
database table for storing product information. A form is needed to add new 
products.
 The form submission is validated, and a new record is created in the 
product table.



Functionalities supported by Hibernate framework:
*************************************************

-> Hibernate framework support Auto DDL operations.

-> In JDBC manually we have to create table and declare the data-type for each and every column.
 
-> But Hibernate can do DDL operations for you internally like creation of table,drop a table,alter a table etc.

-> Hibernate supports Auto Primary key generation. 

-> It means in JDBC we have to manually set a primary key for a table.

-> But Hibernate can this task for you.

-> Hibernate framework is independent of Database because it supports HQL (Hibernate Query Language) 
   which is not specific to any database, whereas JDBC is database dependent.

-> In Hibernate, Exception Handling is not mandatory, whereas In JDBC exception handling is mandatory.

-> Hibernate supports Cache Memory whereas JDBC does not support cache memory.

-> Hibernate is a ORM tool means it support Object relational mapping. Whereas JDBC is not object oriented
   moreover we are dealing with values means primitive data. 

-> In hibernate each record is represented as a Object but in JDBC each record is nothing but a data which is nothing but primitive values.



For creating the Adding product in the database hibernate application in Eclipse IDE, the following steps are 

1.Create the java project
2. Add jar files for hibernate
3. Create the Persistent class
4. Create the mapping file for Persistent class
5. Create the Configuration file
6. Create the class that retrieves or stores the persistent object


-> The class product is created to store the product ID, product name and the quantity.

-> A parameterized constructor along with getters and setters are created for this to show the
model.

-> The Prodc.html is used to get details from the user 

-> The user is asked to enter the product ID, product name and the quantity. The page also
   contains a submit button which takes the user to the display page where the product details are displayed.

-> Inside index.jpg page, html file is linked to it.

-> It will send the response to servlet ,and we get the configure connection from hibernate.cfg.xml.

-> From the xml file connection is created to the database and the objects created in the servlet are get stored in the table.

-> Finally, the data is stored in the database.
