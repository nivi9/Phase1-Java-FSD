DESCRIPTION
Project objective: 
-----------------
Build a responsive website for a restaurant where users can read the details of the restaurant.’

Background of the problem statement: 
------------------------------------
You are a web developer at a service-based web development company called Kite Technologies. The company has been approached by a client who wants to build a website for their restaurant named Ming’s Diner. The website should provide the users a brief overview of the restaurant and its bestsellers, its address, as well as an option to contact the restaurant. During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop the website. 

The tasks you are responsible for: 
----------------------------------
● Building the website using HTML
● Adding Bootstrap to the website
● Adding a landing page, a navbar, a CTA button, a grid, and a footer
● Adding a contact form for users to contact the restaurant
● Pushing the code to the git repository


STEPS:
------

-> First I created an outline for this project, determining what html pages would be necessary.

->I narrowed it down to a home page, a menu page, an order page, a contact page, and a page to navigate to the other pages.

->First I used the Bootstrap documentation to add it to all of the html pages. 

->And then added a nav bar to the top of all the pages for easier navigation. 

->Added the carousel to the homepage, showcasing some images. 

->Added a grid to the homepage and added some temporary text with the Hours of Operation, and Delivery information, Special Offers and Discounts.

->Last, I added a call to action button to a card placed at the bottom of the page. 

->The footer element of the card to satisfy that criteria as well.
