Background of the problem statement:
************************************

As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, a REST resource is needed to capture user feedback. 
Feedback data will be received from third-party apps and websites. The data will be sent to the REST API which will collect feedback from various sources.


-> First I used SpringInitilzr to create my project. 

-> After downloading it I loaded it into eclipse and edited the Application Properties file to connect with my database.

-> I added dependencies to the pom.xml file and added a homepage with forms to input feedback and view the table of all the feedback.

-> I created a feedback page for displaying all the feedback which uses the toString method from the feedback class and outputs it in a table format. 

-> I created a controller for the update to show that the feedback was successfully updated to the table.

-> This controller has a link to the feedback page to view the table. 

-> I made a class called FeedbackRepository which extends CrudRepository to make the necessary changes to the table.

-> Last, I made css changes to have the website be more visually appealing
