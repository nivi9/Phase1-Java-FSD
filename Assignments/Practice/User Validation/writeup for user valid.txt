                                                        WRITEUP FOR USER VALIDATION

Problem Statement:

As a developer, write a program for VALIDATION OF USER LOGIN

-> Using Java, The web pages that serve the purpose of logging into the application, 
and upon authorized authenticated credentials, the rest of the application screens can be seen. 
Hence it is much essential to have a login form to accept the inputs from users and then validate the data. 
For validating the data, we can use javascript at the client-side. 


-> Once client-side validations are over, entered credentials are checked against the database stored data.
 This process can be done only on the server-side. That means those kinds of validations need to be sent as a request
 to the server and the code needs to be written in Servlet. Usually, as login form credentials are sensitive
 and should be hidden while passing, it has to get sent as a POST method. 
 we can design a basic login form and do processing via a servlet. 

-> Create three java class file
1.Login.java
2.Logout.java
3.Dashboard.java

-> HTML file is used to design the login form

Create index.html file

1. LOGIN.JAVA
-----------

In Login Servlet, 

-> PrintWriter() is used to write a formatted string to the writer using specified arguments and format string.
It is used to print an object.

-> getParameter() returns the value of a request parameter as a String.
It returns the value of username and password


-> Using if condition to check the userid and password, if username and password matches

Then it will print "Welcome to the user"
Else it will print "Please try again"

2.LOGOUT.JAVA
------------

-> HttpSession() Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or 
visit to a Web site and to store information about that user. 

-> The servlet container uses this interface to create a session between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. 

-> if session is not null, it will print "Logged out Successfully"

3.DASHBOARD.JAVA
----------------

If session is not null, it will print the username .

else, it will print login first.


-> Upon successful client-side validation and server-side validation, a web page opens and gives login page.
-> If user given incorrect credentials then it gives Invalid email and password" And again displays a login page
