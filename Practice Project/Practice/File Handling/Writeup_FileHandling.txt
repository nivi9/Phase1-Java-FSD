                                                                WRITEUP FOR FILE HANDLING




Background of the problem statement:

As a developer, write a Java code to read, write, and append to a file.


-> The package named java.nio that can be used to work with files.

-> To create an object of File, we need to import the java.io.File package first. 

-> Once we import the package, we can create objects of file and created a file object named file.

-> The object can be used to work with files and directories.

CREATE A FILE:

-> To create a new file, we can use the createNewFile() method. 

-> If the file is successfully created, it will return "File is Created"

-> If the file already exists in the specified location, it will return "file already exists".

READING FROM A FILE:

-> To read data from the file, we can use subclasses of either InputStream or Reader.

WRITE TO A FILE:

-> We use the FileWriter class along with its write() method in order to write some text to the file.

APPEND A FILE:

-> we can append a string in an existing file using FileWriter which has an option to open a file in append mode. 

-> Java FileWriter class is used to write character-oriented data to a file.
